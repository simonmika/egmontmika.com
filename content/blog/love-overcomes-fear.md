One primary characteristic of virtually all religious systems around the world is fear: 
fear of judgment, fear of curses, fear of hell, fear of punishment, fear of failing - 
held up by some sort of religious control.

Sadly, this also seems to apply to a great extend to what is known as Christianity.

In contrast, read the following:

- "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do 
with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love." (1 John 4:18 NIV)

- "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." (1 John 4:8 NIV) 

- "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will 
strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand." 
(Isaiah 41:10 NIV)

The Spirit of Jesus and the spirits of religion are opposed to each other. 
While religious spirits are producing fear, his Spirit produces love that overcomes fear. 

Admitted, followers of Jesus know what fear is, just like anyone else. Yet, they 
overcome.

Now, here is the challenge for you and me. 

In case that fear, guilt or shame, still characterize your relationship to God, 
you might still be captured inside a religious system, rather than loving God and loving people. 
Although, this is what you really want.

In this case, wouldn't it be time for a change?

Nothing less than a paradigm shift.
