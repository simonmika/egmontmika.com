      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-to-start-a-church-2/'>How to Start a Church</a></h1>
          <p><time>2016/11/22</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>It’s easy to imagine that the only way to start a church is by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Renting an auditorium,</li>
<li>Engaging a speaker and a worship team,</li>
<li>Gathering a crowd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, there is another way.</p>

<p>You don’t need all of this, not even money. Instead of starting an organisation with a programme, you could rather ignite a process of disciple making. And you can do this right where you are, wherever you live, work, study or spend your spare time. You start out by making just one disciple of Jesus. And then another one, and another. One or two at a time, sometimes even a couple or a family.</p>

<p>And by demonstrating and being an example, you teach these people to do the same with their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Your home base is your kitchen table. This is where you gather, share your meals, pray, teach, mentor and empower those who want to join you. This is where everythings starts.</p>

<p>Your area of operation is your social network, your family, relatives, friends and colleagues. Then the city, its streets and squares, the parks, shopping centers, restaurants and cafés, the gyms and clubs… any place where you can meet people.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, there will be a fellowship of Jesus-followers.</p>

<p>This is church.</p>

<p>It may seem a lot easier, faster and more rewarding way to rent an auditorium, engage a speaker and a worship team and make enough noise to attract a crowd, then call it a “church”.</p>

<p>The question is, what Jesus would call it.</p>

<p>And - how would he do it?</p>

        </header>
        <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s time for a change.</p>

<p>From time to time, following Jesus requires a new decision.
Why can it be so hard to take that decision?</p>

<p>Would it mean that your former decisions, traditions and habits, your arguments,
convictions and priorities become meaningless?</p>

<p>Would it mean that <em>all</em> was wrong?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Probably, it all was right, based on the
information you had at that time. But now you know more. Now you have a
better understanding.</p>

<p>Now you feel the need for a change.</p>

<p>So, what will you do?</p>

<p>Will you let your tradition or habit or convenience be strong enough to override your desire
for a new and better decision?</p>

<p>Or will you give in to peer pressure of sticking with
your &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;, your relatives and friends or your group (&ldquo;What will they say?&rdquo;)?</p>

<p>Sometimes, it takes humility and courage to make a new decision.</p>

<p>And trust in the voice of your heart.</p>

<p>Or be afraid that people won&rsquo;t take you serious because you&rsquo;re not sticking to what
you built up and believed in and instead run off to something new and often more uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Egmont</em></p>

<p>True. If you need much confirmation you better stay inside
the box.</p>

<p><em>Kristina</em></p>

<p>Yes, sometimes God invites you to leave everything. We lived in the big city for about 10 years and have been the leaders of a small home church. However, we felt the need to leave it all and move into a small village with just a few people around. Hard to understand such a decision! But we feel so so happy and God already gave us a new church family with really honest and worm people who accepted us so lovingly. Change is good if it is led by God. Sometimes we feel like God already prepared and arranged things in advance and we just go and find it all arranged and set out waiting for us. He is such a provider!</p>

<p><em>Egmont</em></p>

<p>Hi Kristina!
Thank you for your comment. This sounds so right and good. Peace and joy follow those who are being led by the Spirit, no matter what the circumstances. And whenever the situation does not look so great, the family of the Lord stands out even greater. Making one or a few disciples, one by one, who can do the same with other people is the best we can do. No church program can ever match up to that. It’s quality that counts in the Kingdom, not numbers.</p>

<p><em>Kristina</em></p>

<p>Amen, thank you for your encouragement.</p>
