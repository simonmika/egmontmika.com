      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You can change things to the better.</p>

<p>The trust you give, the joy you share, the love you invest, the help you give, the standard you set, the problem you solve, the wisdom you share… have the potential to change things to the better, to become a blessing to you and others.</p>

<p>Moving people foreward.</p>

<p>Causing someone to pick up what you did and act in a similar way, and again, change things to the better, for even more people.  And in turn, cause some of them to do the same and again, change things… again and again. To the better.</p>

<p>Like ripples on the water.</p>

<p>Someone may go further than you, causing greater change. Causing more and stronger ripples, reaching out even further. Still improving what you and others did.</p>

<p>Some of those decisions and actions may have the capacity to create a movement and, as time passes by, involve hundreds or even thousands.</p>

<p>Enduring generations.</p>

<p>Probably, most of your influence never gets recognized in public, though. Nevertheless, it can be powerful, although you hardly ever get to know the real impact of what you did, much less can you manage its final outcome.</p>

<p>The secret is to let go, to not expect anything back. Resisting the temptation to take control.</p>

<p>Let others receive freely, enjoy the benefit, then pass it on freely and again, let it go. One day, it will go on without you, yet still because of your initiative - thanks to you.</p>

<p>Increasing your impact.</p>

<p>To the benefit of many.</p>

<p>And to His glory!</p>

        <p>You are a follower of Jesus? In this case, you might be interested in the question,</p>

<p><em>What matters to Jesus?</em></p>

<p>Jesus himself said, it’s the glory of his Father in Heaven. To honor Him and to carry out His will. How did he do this?</p>

<p>By loving people.</p>

<p>For Jesus, this meant sharing his life and giving his life.</p>

<p>Today, the Father is about to prepare humanity for eternity by building His universal family. And He does this in the power of His Spirit and through those who already responded to His love and follow Jesus.</p>

<p>As a disciple of Jesus, you are an agent of Father’s love in this world.</p>

<p>For you, this means sharing your life and giving your life.</p>

<p>You may lift your hands and sing worship songs, you may fast and spend hours in prayer in order to honor God. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>Yet, if the outcome is not that you do His will and care for the people He wants to reach with His love, then you are just caring for your own spirituality and your own salvation.</p>

<p>You can’t honor the Father without caring for the ones He cares for.</p>

<p>What matters to Jesus? To him, this is totally clear.</p>

<p>What matters to you?</p>
