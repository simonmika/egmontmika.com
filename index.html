      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You can’t argue a person into Heaven.</p>

<p>In spiritual matters arguing is futile. Even worse, it’s counterproductive.
Each argument will provoke at least one counter-argument, supplying your opponent
with still another brick for his defense wall.</p>

<p>Arguing presumes that we can use force of will to change minds - and souls.
Yet, force begets counterforce. And what would be the benefit of winning an
argument, anyway? Probably you&rsquo;d produce another wisenheimer, (one just like you and me, in this case).</p>

<p>There is a better way.</p>

<p>The path forward, it seems, is to connect, to engage and to serve. To teach patiently and
earn credibility by living what you teach. To build trust. Then, inviting the other person to join you in
your journey.</p>

<p>However, this seldom happens overnight. It takes time and commitment and humility. And honest
concern for the other person.</p>

<p>Becoming a disciple of Jesus starts with a free and trusting decision from within.</p>

<p>A heart decision.</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-to-start-a-church-2/'>How to Start a Church</a></h1>

        <p>It’s easy to imagine that the only way to start a church is by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Renting an auditorium,</li>
<li>Engaging a speaker and a worship team,</li>
<li>Gathering a crowd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, there is another way.</p>

<p>You don’t need all of this, not even money. Instead of starting an organisation with a program, you could ignite a process of disciple making. And you can do this right where you are, wherever you live, work, study or spend your spare time. You start out by making just one disciple of Jesus. And then another one, and another. One or two at a time, sometimes even a couple or a family.</p>

<p>And by demonstrating and being an example, you teach these people to do the same with their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Your home base is your kitchen table. This is where you gather, share your meals, pray, teach, mentor and empower those who want to join you. This is where everythings starts.</p>

<p>Your area of operation is your social network, your family, relatives, friends and colleagues. Then the city, its streets and squares, the parks, shopping centers, restaurants and cafés, the gyms and clubs… any place where you can meet people.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, there will be a fellowship of Jesus-followers.</p>

<p>This is church.</p>

<p>It may seem a lot easier, faster and more rewarding way to rent an auditorium, engage a speaker and a worship team and make enough noise to attract a crowd, then call it a “church”.</p>

<p>The question is, what Jesus would call it.</p>

<p>And - how would he do it?</p>
