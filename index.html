      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You can thrive your career, acquire wealth and reputation, even experience tremendous impact in your ministry. Yet, if your relationships are poor&hellip;</p>

<p>Then nothing else matters.</p>

<p>Investing in people is the best you can ever do.</p>

<p>Giving your time and efforts or whatever you have, ultimately giving your love.</p>

<p>Love is the only currency with eternal value. And its value increases the more you give.</p>

<p>Like any other investment, though, love investments include risks. People can cheat you, disappoint you or just neglect you. Someone you love with all of your heart may one day turn against you and hate you.</p>

<p>Therefore, to pin your hopes on people doesn’t seem to be quite safe, at least not in short term thinking. However, don’t get confused when your love is rejected.</p>

<p>The real value of your investments will finally show. If not in this life-time, then at the latest in eternity.</p>

<p>Jesus was aware of that. He knew he could not fully rely on people, not even on his closest friends. However, in the face of suffering betrayal, hatred and torture to the fullest, he gave them everything.</p>

<p>He never gave up loving. It cost him his life.</p>

<p>Yet, is there anything more worth living and dying for?</p>

        <p>Most probably, it’s not the public opinion.</p>

<p>And not what everybody is talking about right now at the coffee table.</p>

<p>Like today’s hottest news or sensation or scandal, created by the media. Or this season’s trendiest fashion or coolest design or latest ”must have”, launched by the market. And it&rsquo;s certainly not the score of last night’s soccer game.</p>

<p>What really matters is probably not whatever tries to steal your attention right now.</p>

<p>Rather, it is what you by focusing on your life’s purpose nourish in your heart and, following your values, diligently, patiently, drip by drip, carve out as your daily walk and your path of life. By translating your purpose into daily action, here and now.</p>

<p>Doing what is necessary.</p>

<p>Overcoming complacency and convenience and the fear of rejection. Conquering the resistance from within you and the opinions around you.</p>

<p>Confidently, faithfully and joyfully pursuing what you can see as your destiny.</p>

<p>Because you know, it’s right.</p>
