      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s time for a change.</p>

<p>From time to time, following Jesus requires a new decision.
Why can it be so hard to take that decision?</p>

<p>Would it mean that your former decisions, traditions and habits, your arguments,
convictions and priorities become meaningless?</p>

<p>Would it mean that <em>all</em> was wrong?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Probably, it all was right, based on the
information you had at that time. But now you know more. Now you have a
better understanding.</p>

<p>Now you feel the need for a change.</p>

<p>So, what will you do?</p>

<p>Will you let your tradition or habit or convenience be strong enough to override your desire
for a new and better decision?</p>

<p>Or will you give in to peer pressure of sticking with
your &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;, your relatives and friends or your group (for what will they say?)?</p>

<p>Sometimes, it takes humility and courage to make a new decision.</p>

<p>And trust in the voice of your heart.</p>

        <p>Broken trust is painful.</p>

<p>People can be wonderful, but also give you a nightmare. Loving people includes the risk of getting hurt.
The more you love, the more vulnerable you get, the more pain you may have to suffer.</p>

<p>Worst of all, the suffering of broken trust. Suffering a life-long injury.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to play safe, don’t get engaged with people. Don’t love, don’t care. Keep out of reach. Keep the mask. Play cool.</p>

<p>However, what kind of a life would that be!</p>

<p>We are not created as islands. We need each other. Need to care.</p>

<p>And to love.</p>

<p>That requires courage. So, let’s not get intimidated or scared by negative experiences. Instead, let&rsquo;s engage with people. Make ourselves vulnerable. Take the risk, over and over again.</p>

<p>And be prepared to suffer.</p>

<p>It may make you feel like a looser, yet, would there be an option?</p>

<p>Could Jesus do it better?</p>
