      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You are a follower of Jesus? In this case, you might be interested in the question,</p>

<p><em>What matters to Jesus?</em></p>

<p>Jesus himself said, it’s the glory of his Father in Heaven. To honor Him and to carry out His will. How did he do this?</p>

<p>By loving people.</p>

<p>For Jesus, this meant sharing his life and giving his life.</p>

<p>Today, the Father is about to prepare humanity for eternity by building His universal family. And He does this in the power of His Spirit and through those who already responded to His love and follow Jesus.</p>

<p>As a disciple of Jesus, you are an agent of Father’s love in this world.</p>

<p>For you, this means sharing your life and giving your life.</p>

<p>You may lift your hands and sing worship songs, you may fast and spend hours in prayer in order to honor God. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>Yet, if the outcome is not that you do His will and care for the people He wants to reach with His love, then you are just caring for your own spirituality and your own salvation.</p>

<p>You can’t honor the Father without caring for the ones He cares for.</p>

<p>What matters to Jesus? To him, this is totally clear.</p>

<p>What matters to you?</p>

        <p>You can thrive your career, acquire wealth and reputation, even experience tremendous impact in your ministry. Yet, if your relationships are poor&hellip;</p>

<p>Then nothing else matters.</p>

<p>Investing in people is the best you can ever do.</p>

<p>Giving your time and efforts or whatever you have, ultimately giving your love.</p>

<p>Love is the only currency with eternal value. And its value increases the more you give.</p>

<p>Like any other investment, though, love investments include risks. People can cheat you, disappoint you or just neglect you. Someone you love with all of your heart may one day turn against you and hate you.</p>

<p>Therefore, to pin your hopes on people doesn’t seem to be quite safe, at least not in short term thinking. However, don’t get confused when your love is rejected.</p>

<p>The real value of your investments will finally show. If not in this life-time, then at the latest in eternity.</p>

<p>Jesus was aware of that. He knew he could not fully rely on people, not even on his closest friends. However, in the face of suffering betrayal, hatred and torture to the fullest, he gave them everything.</p>

<p>He never gave up loving. It cost him his life.</p>

<p>Yet, is there anything more worth living and dying for?</p>
